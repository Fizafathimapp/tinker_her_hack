# WANDER AI ✈️

**Resolve the argument phase. Swipe. Sync. Travel.**

TripMaker AI is a premium, mobile-first group travel decision engine designed to eliminate the friction of planning trips with friends. By moving away from endless group chats and indecision, TripMaker AI uses an intuitive, swipe-based preference selection system to anonymously gather group choices and generate an "AI-driven" conflict report with actionable compromises.

● **Real-time Confidence Meter**: Visual tracking of group momentum and agreement percentages during the swiping phase.  
● **AI Conflict Report**: A password-protected dashboard for the coordinator, highlighting group consensus, detecting clashing preferences, and suggesting ideal compromises.  
● **Privacy-First Voting**: Anonymous member preferences ensure honest feedback without group pressure.  
● **One-Click Sharing**: Generate 6-digit trip codes and QR codes for instant member onboarding via WhatsApp, email, or direct link.
